# Deep Reinforcement Learning - Collaboration and Competition Project

In this notebook, we have implemented the [Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275) reinforcement learning algorithm for the "Collaboration and Competition" project of the [Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).
